# Prompt & Alert
Write a program that accepts users input and displays messages back to the user. 

# What I learned
- Use Terminal
- Create a repository in Github and ASP
- Create index.html with its tags
- Created script tag to nest first JS codes in html for this time
- Alert pops up a message or question 
- prompt does the same thing that alert does with a text field 
- Store the texts inputs by assigning a variable to the prompt question which allows us to use the input later.
- Console log a message To monitor the Q&A if needed (before the page is refreshed)
